### Kernel Density Estimation Library:
KernelDensityEstimate2d contains methods for performing 2D Kernel Density Estimation.
f you've got some points and want to convert them into a Probability Distribution Function
convolving the points with a kernel, KernelDensityEstimate2d will compute that kernel for
you.

Also includes a pure java implementation of Matlab's FZero function.


### Build:
$ ant


### Runtime:
After build, add all jars in **lib** and **target** directories to your project.
