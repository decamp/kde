THE KDE LIBRARY:
- KernelDensityEstimate2d contains methods for performing 2D Kernel Density Estimation.
  If you've got some points and want to convert them into a Probability Distribution Function
  convolving the points with a kernel, KernelDensityEstimate2d will compute that kernel for
  you.
- A pure java Fast-Fourier Transform (1d and 2d, real and complex).
- A pure java Fast-Cosine Transform ( 1d and 2d ).
- A pure java implementation of Matlab's FZero function.


BUILDING:
1. ant


RUNTIME:
1. All files in "lib" and "dist" directories (after build) are required in classpath.
